# Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive test suite and sample implementations demonstrating various software engineering concepts and patterns. The codebase is organized into multiple modules covering algorithms, data structures, design patterns, and system design examples.

Key areas include:
- Algorithm implementations (sorting, searching, dynamic programming)
- Data structure examples (trees, graphs, heaps, tries)
- Design pattern demonstrations (creational, structural, behavioral)
- System design samples (URL shortener, rate limiter, cache systems)
- Testing utilities and examples

## Build & Test Commands

No build or test commands were identified in the repository analysis. This appears to be a reference/educational repository with standalone code samples rather than a buildable project with a unified build system.

## High-Risk Areas

Since this is primarily an educational/reference repository with sample implementations, there are no production-critical high-risk areas. However, when studying or adapting code:

- Algorithm implementations may have edge cases not fully covered
- System design examples are simplified demonstrations, not production-ready code
- Thread safety and concurrency patterns should be carefully reviewed before production use
- Performance characteristics of data structures may vary based on use case

## Code Conventions

Based on the repository structure and typical patterns for such codebases:

- Use clear, descriptive naming for classes and methods
- Include comments explaining algorithm complexity and trade-offs
- Organize code by concept/pattern type in appropriate directories
- Keep examples self-contained and independently runnable where possible
- Document assumptions and limitations of implementations

## Recent Work Context

No recent commit history or work context was provided in the analysis data. This appears to be a stable reference repository rather than an actively developed project.
